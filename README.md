- ##  Intelligent Portfolio Website Creation with AWS Amplify & Comprehend
In this project, I made use of Python and AWS to create an intelligent data science portfolio website. At a high-level, the website was hosted in a serverless manner on AWS using Amplify; AWS Comprehend was used to generate a NLP solution, while AWS SES was used to send the automated responses. This NLP solution allows the website to automatically populate and send intelligent emails to interested parties based on the messages they send through the website.
